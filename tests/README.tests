Test Framework added in Version 3.0
4 tests as of Version 3.0

class files to be tested are in		logfiles and reference files are in tests/log/
tests/testi/
					  			  in case of an error:
#					default		run       run
#test 1 test.java			log/1.out	1.log	  1.err
#test 2 class showing finally bug	log/2.out	2.log	  2.err
#test 3	sample from java/io/* 1.3	log/3.out	3.log	  3.err
#test 4 sample from java/io/* 1.4	log/4.out	4.log	  4.err
...
#test i .......				log/i.out	i.log	  i.err
...
#test N java/*				log/n.out	n.log	  n.err


to run testsuite using valgrind  try "./testall.sh --valgrind"

The idea of the test framework is to check after every change
in the source code of jlint whether it still behaves the same
as before the changes. To achieve that the changed jlint is 
run on sample programs and the output is compared to the output
of a version of jlint known to be correct on the same sample 
programs. The original output is stored in *.out files while 
the current output is written into *.log files. These files are 
compared and if they differ the test framework will output a 
warning, specifying which file produced the difference. If 
jlint crashes during testing, the error messages are written 
into *.err files.
