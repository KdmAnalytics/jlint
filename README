   gunzip -c jlint.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

Compilation problems:
---------------------
If Jlint won't compile for your system, remove the flags -DHASH_TABLE and
-DSLIST in the Makefile, or upgrade to a newer version of the STL.

People with an old compiler (e.g., egcs 2.91 on RedHat GNU/Linux 6.x)
should comment out two lines (thanks to Eric A. Raymond for this patch):

jlint.cc
Line
57  // Commented out by EAR to compile on Linux
58  //message_node* message_node::hash_table[1023];

message_node.cc
3  // Commented out extern by EAR to compile on Linux
4  /* extern */ message_node* message_node::hash_table[1023];

Developer info: you can update the Makefile by typing
./mkmf.pl jlint antic readme <Makefile >__tmp__ ; mv __tmp__ Makefile
