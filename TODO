 To do

* (1) Restructuring/rewriting of the data structures. Some
  classes are poorly designed, and in general the given
  framework is inadequate for more powerful analysis (such
  as the analysis of lock sets when calls from one class
  to another class are made).
  See thesis report for details.

* (2) Context merging (return, exceptions, if, while, for)
  will eliminate some spurious warnings.

* (2) Variables and methods that are read-only:

  * Variable is not accessed outside constructor or synchronized(this)
    block.

  * Method does not access fields that are not read only
    (according to the definition above).

* (2) Full analysis of lock sets across method/class boundaries
  for wait/notify calls.

* (2) Non-synchronized method where object instance is not
  visible outside current thread (e. g. local variable)
  can be called. Requires evaluating accessor information.

* (2) Improve verbosity/information content of some (existing)
  warnings.

* (3) Support for getClass() in synchronization.

* (3) Eliminate spurious warnings where implicit synchronization
  exists (e. g. streams)

* (3) Documentation: better tagging of text (e. g. @var),
  full @node tree for document
