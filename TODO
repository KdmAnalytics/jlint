 To do

* (2) Context merging (return, exceptions, if, while, for)
  will eliminate some spurious warnings.

* (2) Variables and methods that are read-only:

  * Variable is not accessed outside constructor or synchronized(this)
    block.

  * Method does not access fields that are not read only
    (according to the definition above).

* (2) Non-synchronized method where object instance is not
  visible outside current thread (e. g. local variable)
  can be called. Requires evaluating accessor information.

* (2) Improve verbosity/information content of some (existing)
  warnings.

* (3) Support for getClass() in synchronization.

* (3) Eliminate spurious warnings where implicit synchronization
  exists (e. g. streams)

* (3) Documentation: better tagging of text (e. g. @var),
  full @node tree for document
